Originally planned on using the Todoist API, but this was to hard to upload a
file as a comment. So I decided to send the file as an email to my Todoist
inbox.

I am now trying to find the fastest way to capture an email, when the script was
bundled into an executable, it took 8.5 seconds before the screenshot was taken.

I am now trying to just call the script with a batch file to see if that will be
faster.

Using a VBS script to call a batch file to call the program only took 2 seconds,
so this is how the program will be called from now on.
